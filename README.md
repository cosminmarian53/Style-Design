# Style Design
This is the first version of the website, for now it only has really simple things and add-ons and it will require more time and work to function properly.
Currently, two official plugins are available:

# Second Commit
I have added a few animations for the cards, and a footer. After this I will add a switch-to-dark-mode button.

# Fifth Commit
Rearrenged the Footer and made some new components to make it more easily readable and cleaner.

# Sixth Commit
Added a toggle-to-dark-mode functional button for the home navbar.

# Important Update
From now on, all of my commit descriptions will now be present in their respective description instead of the README. Here I will only add notes that I consider important about the website.




Note: To run the website you need have installed Node.js . After you've made sure that Node.js is installed, in this folder run the command npm i, to install all the dependencies, and then run the following command: npm run dev to start the localhosting for the website.
